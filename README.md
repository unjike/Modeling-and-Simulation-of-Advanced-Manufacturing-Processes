## Simulation and Optimization of a Spark-Sintering Material Manufacturing Process
Sintering is a process by which a material of a specific characteristic is produced by compressing a
relevant powdered stock of material. The raw material in this process is usually a powdered metal,
which can be iron, copper, or an alloy of metals. Depending on the composition of the final material, the
based powdered is mixed with an alloying element. This powder mixture is then compacted in a tooling
which has the negative shape of the desired final material shape. The compacted material is usually
heated such that the temperature reaches about 70% - 90% of its melting point. This approach to
manufacturing has several advantages compared to conventional approaches. The advantages includes
the ability to process materials that cannot be melted and the resulting processed material is highly
pure.

In general, sintering processes cost more than conventional processes like casting and machining.
However, continuous research is looking for ways to make the process cheaper and expand its application
beyond niche markets. Electrically aided sintering is a promissing variation of the sintering process. In
this project report, I explored one type of electrically aided sintering called spark sintering. In spark
sintering, loose powder is confined in a graphite mold. This powder is simultaneously joule heated
and compressed mechanically. This report describes how I encoded a numerical model to simulate
the spark sintering process. The model also provides a visualization of how some material properties
change over time. A genetic algorithm is then applied to this numerical model simulation to predict the
parameters needed to achieve desired properties in the final product. The best obtained cost function
had a value as low as 1.34 ×10−10 for the design of a material that must not exceed a temperature of
650K and that is fully densified.
